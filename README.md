## What is directions?

directions is a challenging web game that requires you to match directions with arrow keys in 2 seconds or less.

## How does it work?

### Gameplay

The user can press any key or click anywhere to start the game.

A word ("up", "left", "down" or "right") will appear on the screen. You'll have less than two seconds to press the corresponding arrow key on your keyboard (sorry, mobile usersâ€”though the game is responsive, mobile-friendly gameplay is still in the works).

If you choose the correct key, the next word will pop up once time has expired. As time goes on, you'll see additional directions and multipliers. For example, if you see "left x2", that means you'll need to press the left arrow key twice. You'll have less time for each set of directions as the game progresses, so be fast!

When you make a mistake, the game will end. You'll see how long you lasted, as well as your score. To reload the game, simply press or click anywhere.

### Highlights

Development features include:
* A clean, responsive design using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* CSS transitions
* DOM manipulation
* Scheduling in JavaScript
